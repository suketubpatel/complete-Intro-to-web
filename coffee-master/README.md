Let's do a project together.

This will stretch you a bit and make you use everything we learned together. It's a bit advance but you have the skills to do it.

We're going to make the checkout page for a coffee app. It looks like this:

Some notes:

You get to do the HTML and the CSS here.
The logo for Coffee Masters is here.
We didn't talk about how to make rounded corners. It's with border-radius.
There are many ways to do this. Flex and grid would work well, just don't go overboard with grid, it'd be hard to 100% handle this layout in just grid.
HTML inputs can be styled with HTML just as you expect.
We also didn't talk about box shadows. You can give it the nice little shadow effect with the CSS property box-shadow.
I took about 100 lines of HTML and 150 lines of CSS. Again, you do not need to do it the way I did. There are infinite correct ways to do this.
I ended up using grid and flex in different places. Neither is required but can make some parts easier.
You don't have to match the design perfectly. Just get the general style close.

Good Luck!
This time I'm going to make you write both the HTML and the CSS. Consider this a capstone project for the first two sections!
